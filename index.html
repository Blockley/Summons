<p class="psmall"><em>“Be very cautious, whom you recommend as a candidate for Membership; one false step on this point may be fatal. If you introduce a disputatious person, confusion will be produced which may end in the dissolution of the Lodge. If you have a good Lodge keep it select. Great numbers are not always beneficial.”</em> – Dr Oliver<p>
